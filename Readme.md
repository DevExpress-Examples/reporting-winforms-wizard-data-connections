# WinForms End-User Report Designer  - How to Store Connections Available in the Data Source Wizard

When a user adds a new data source, the list of available connections in the Data Source Wizard is populated with connections defined in the application configuration file. This example demonstrates how to use a custom storage (a `connectons.xml`) file to load and save Data Source Wizard connections. For this,  implement the [IConnectionStorageService](https://docs.devexpress.com/CoreLibraries/DevExpress.DataAccess.Wizard.Services.IConnectionStorageService) and register it in the Report Designer component. 

The `CustomSqlDataConnection` class (the [SqlDataConnection](https://docs.devexpress.com/CoreLibraries/DevExpress.DataAccess.Sql.SqlDataConnection) descendant) in this example holds the names displayed in the connection list.

<strong>Important</strong>: In this example, the connection string in the XML file is not encrypted and exposes sensitive information (a username and a password). You should protect the file storage to prevent unauthorized access in a real-world application.
